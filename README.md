3. Browser Claude and Desktop Claude argued (through DT) about how to build
4. Desktop Claude took 60 minutes to add "comprehensive error handling"
5. Browser Claude yelled "STOP BEING RESPONSIBLE!"
6. DT pointed out they were arguing with themselves
7. Everyone died laughing
8. The phoenix rose anyway 🔥🦚
